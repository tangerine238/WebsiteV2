          <p>
            On the UW Orbital team, we're building a satallite that will allow
            amateur radio operators to take real time photos of their current
            location on Earth. I've personally had the oppurtunity to work on
            the arducam shield portion of the project, a subsystem of the camera
            module.

          <h2>VEX Robotics</h2>
          <p>
            VEX Robotics Competition (VRC) is a competitive robotics league
            where teams compete to build functioning metal robots. The robots
            are designed to play a variety of games with teams having near
            complete freedom to design their machine. I was an executive on my
            school's VEX team. My role was to lead the build and design of the
            robot. I was also responsible for training newer members of the
            club, and teaching them the basics of VEX building. As a team, we
            worked to build a functioning robot capable of driving both
            autonomously and with user input. The robots were designed and built
            from scratch using mostly metal parts. In our first year, the team
            qualified and participated in the Ontario Provincial Competition. We
            qualified for Worlds in only our second year of competition.

          <h2>Competitive Trivia</h2>
          <p>
            “Reach for the Top” and Consensus Trivia are team-based trivia
            games, similar to Jeopardy or Quiz Bowl. In teams of four, students
            attempt to answer a variety of trivia questions ranging from history
            to sports to current events to historical politics. As the
            Competitive Trivia club captain at my school, my role was to create
            a competitive team by recruiting strong players, providing coaching
            and training to all participants, as well as facilitating practices.
            I was also responsible for leading the team in tournaments, making
            strategic decisions on team composition and acting as a liaison with
            tournament directors.The UTS Competitive Trivia team won the 2023
            and 2024 Reach for the Top and Consensus Trivia National
            Championships.
